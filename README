Query Classes
===========

This project is a small set of code that demonstrates the use of query classes with an ORM, in this case NHibernate. 

When using Query Classes each query in the application is represented by a class, called a specification. The specification defines the query, the sort order and any required eager loading.

The main design goal of Query Classes is to encapsulate query logic and to prevent query logic from spreading around an application. In this way it is a similar strategy to the Repository Pattern as originally specified in DDD, except I think that Query Classes are more lightweight.
